Super Fossil Joomla Plugin
==========================

This plugin makes it simple for you to implement [Respond.js](https://github.com/scottjehl/Respond) and [Selectivizr](https://github.com/keithclark/selectivizr) on your Joomla powered Websites.
The goal of this script is to provide fast and lightweight scripts to enable responsive web designs in browsers that don't support CSS3 Media Queries - in particular, Internet Explorer 8 and under and well as emulate CSS3 pseudo-classes and attribute selectors in Internet Explorer 6-8.

This project is a work in progress and your feedback and suggestions are welcome.
